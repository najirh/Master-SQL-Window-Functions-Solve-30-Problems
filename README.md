```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    hire_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, department, salary, hire_date)

(25, 'Yara', 'Finance', 82000, '2021-06-30');
```

### Problems: ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK
#### Basic to Medium:
1. **Find the row number of each employee ordered by salary.**
   - Use `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)`.
2. **Rank employees based on their salaries.**
   - Use `RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)`.
3. **Dense rank employees within each department based on salary.**
   - Use `DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)`.
4. **Rank employees by hire date.**
   - Use `RANK() OVER (ORDER BY hire_date ASC)`.
5. **Find the row number of each employee within the department.**
   - Use `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY hire_date)`.

#### Advanced:
6. **Find the employee with the highest salary in each department.**
   - Use `RANK()` and `WHERE rank = 1`.
7. **Calculate the rank difference between departments for employees with the same salary.**
   - Combine `RANK()` with a self-join.
8. **Get the 2nd highest salary in each department.**
   - Use `RANK()` and `WHERE rank = 2`.
9. **Find the average salary of the top 3 highest-paid employees in each department.**
   - Use `ROW_NUMBER()` with a `PARTITION BY department`.
10. **Assign a dense rank to employees based on their hire date, resetting at each department change.**
    - Combine `DENSE_RANK()` with `PARTITION BY department ORDER BY hire_date`.

### 2. **Dataset 2: Sales Data**

**Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    sale_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    store_location VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, product_name, sale_date, amount, store_location)
VALUES
(1, 'Laptop', '2023-01-15', 1500.00, 'New York'),
(2, 'Headphones', '2023-02-03', 200.00, 'Chicago'),
(3, 'Laptop', '2023-03-10', 1600.00, 'San Francisco'),
(4, 'Phone', '2023-02-21', 800.00, 'New York'),
(5, 'Tablet', '2023-05-15', 600.00, 'Chicago');
```

### Problems: LEAD, LAG
#### Basic to Medium:
1. **Calculate the difference in sales amount between consecutive sales.**
   - Use `LAG(amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date)`.
2. **Find the sale amount for the next product sale.**
   - Use `LEAD(amount, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date)`.
3. **For each product, calculate the difference between the current and previous sale amount.**
   - Use `LAG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY sale_date)`.
4. **Show the next product sold for each store location.**
   - Use `LEAD(product_name) OVER (PARTITION BY store_location ORDER BY sale_date)`.
5. **Find the previous sale amount for each store location.**
   - Use `LAG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY store_location ORDER BY sale_date)`.

#### Advanced:
6. **Calculate the rolling difference between sales for each product.**
   - Use both `LEAD` and `LAG` for comparison.
7. **Identify sales where the previous sale amount was higher than the current sale.**
   - Use `LAG()` with a `WHERE` clause.
8. **For each sale, show the amount from two sales before.**
   - Use `LAG(amount, 2) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date)`.
9. **Compare current sales with the next two sales for each product.**
   - Use `LEAD(amount, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY sale_date)`.
10. **Find the running total of sales for each store location.**
    - Use `SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY store_location ORDER BY sale_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)`.

### 3. **Dataset 3: Student Scores**

**Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE student_scores (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(50),
    subject VARCHAR(50),
    score INT,
    exam_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO student_scores (student_id, student_name, subject, score, exam_date)
VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Math', 85, '2023-05-15'),
(2, 'Jane', 'Math', 95, '2023-05-15'),
(3, 'Jake', 'History', 78, '2023-06-10'),
(4, 'Julia', 'History', 88, '2023-06-10'),
(5, 'Jill', 'Science', 92, '2023-07-01');
```

### Problems: ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LEAD, LAG
#### Basic to Medium:
1. **Rank students by their score in each subject.**
   - Use `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY score DESC)`.
2. **Find the row number of students based on their exam date.**
   - Use `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY exam_date)`.
3. **Identify the score difference between consecutive exams for each student.**
   - Use `LAG(score) OVER (PARTITION BY student_name ORDER BY exam_date)`.
4. **Show the next studentâ€™s score for each subject.**
   - Use `LEAD(score) OVER (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY exam_date)`.
5. **Calculate the dense rank of students based on their score across all subjects.**
   - Use `DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC)`.

#### Advanced:
6. **Rank students within each subject, but reset the rank after every 5 students.**
   - Use `NTILE(5) OVER (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY score DESC)`.
7. **Find students who improved their score compared to the previous exam.**
   - Use `LAG()` and a `WHERE` clause.
8. **Calculate the cumulative score for each student in all subjects.**
   - Use `SUM(score) OVER (PARTITION BY student_name ORDER BY exam_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)`.
9. **Find the second-highest score in each subject.**
   - Use `RANK()` with `WHERE`.
10. **Show students who have not improved compared to their previous exam score.**
    - Use `LAG(score)` with comparison.
